	<h4> Note from the owner:</h4>
		<p> Hi there, my name is Lorraine Zamora and I've been the owner of Mignon since opening day! Hereâ€™s a little about why we got started. At a young age, I hoped that one day I'd be able to spread my love of pastries to everyone around me, and now, that dream has finally become a reality. For every customer that walks through the door, I hope they leave the shop happier than they were entering! </p>
	
	<h4> Why are we called "Mignon"? </h4>
	<p> In French, this means "cute". We purposefully chose this name because this is how we'd like our customers to view and remember our pastries.</p>
